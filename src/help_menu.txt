===============================Census Selector=======+========================
This is a function that helps the user select each sub-data field for each
census card. To use, click the screen around the vertex of each section's box.
Once you have drawn a box around each subfield hit enter and the program will
save your selections so it can run data analysis on the census cards. Below is
a list of each button you can use while drawing the boxes:

_______________________________Box mode controls____________________________
Image mode is the default mode. This mode allows the user to select the
vertical edges of a census card box so that the box can be broken down into
sub images for later analysis.

Controls:
'+'=Increase Vertex Size: Increase the search distance for each box vertex.
'-'=Decrease Vertex Size: Decrease the search distance for each box vertex.
'→'=Right: Show the next image preview.
'←'=Left: Show the previous image preview.
'h'=Help: print this help menu to the terminal.
'u'=Undo: Undo your last action.
'r'=Redo: Redo the last undo.
'd'=Display: Toggle between displaying and hiding the boxes you have drawn.
't'=Text mode: Enter text mode on most recent box.
'l'=Image mode: Enter image mode on current image.
'q'=Quit: Quit the application (without saving!).
's'=Save: saves your selections as sub-problems. Only use when you are done!
'ctrl+v'=preview: Show/Hide preview box.

_______________________________Text mode controls_____________________________
Text mode allows the user to enter the name of a box. This mode behaves like
most standardized text box editing. None of the image mode controls will work
while text mode is enabled. This mode is activated when the user creates a new
box and is disabled when the user hits enter on the keyboard (saving the box
name). Note: the text viewed on screen is wrapped but only the raw input is
saved to the json. This means the word wrapping is purely visual and has no
impact on what is saved to the json.

Controls:
'character'=Entering any ascii letter or symbol will type to the box name.
'←'=Left: Move the cursor left.
'→'=Right: Move the cursor right.
'backspace': Delete the character to the left of the cursor.
'delete': Delete the character to the right of the cursor.
'home': Jump to the front of the line.
'end': Jump to the end of the line.
'ctrl+backspace': Delete word left of the cursor.
'return': save the box name and exit text mode.
'ctrl+v': Show/Hide preview box.

______________________________Image mode controls_____________________________
Image mode allows the user to shift the current image allowing for better
aligned images. While in this mode the user cannot edit boxes. Note: when
saving the shift will overwrite the image in the image folder. This cannot
be undone. Additionally, shifting the image left or up will lossily crop the
image. The only way to undo a saved image mode edit is to replace the image
manually from the file explorer.

Controls:
'↑'=Up: Shift the image up. DELETES the pixels on the top.
'←'=Left: Shift the image left. DELETES the pixels on the left.
'→'=Right: Shift the image right. Adds a border on left side.
'↓'=Down: Shift the image down. Adds border on the top side.
'r'=Reset: Reset the current shift.
'l'=Quit: quit out of image mode.
'return'=Save: save the image edit and overwrite the original file.
'ctrl+v'=Preview: show/hide preview box
